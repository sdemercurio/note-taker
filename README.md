# Express Note Taker

## Description:
This is an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

## Issues:
This application is unfortunately a work in progress while I continue to understand the functionality better. Data does not appear to be saved or retrieved from the json file. The server does run and links function as they should, however I was unable to make sense of it all and this is not a completed app.

There also appears to be an issue with duplicate elements and glitchy css on the notes.html page.

## Installation:
The user would normally visit [this link](https://immense-dawn-70868.herokuapp.com/
) where the app is live on Heroku.

## Contributing:
Anyone willing to help me complete this application is more than welcome to reach out to me.
